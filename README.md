# LED Rhombicosidodecahedron

Version-controlled OpenSCAD sources for a 42-panel LED sculpture based on a
rhombicosidodecahedron:

- 30 LED panels occupy the square faces.
- 12 additional LED panels sit in the pentagonal openings.
- 20 identical triangle fillers close the triangular openings.

The source geometry was migrated from the project's
[ChatGPT design conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/6a78d835-25d0-83ed-a959-b31c6b7b4f29).
Git history is the version history; do not create numbered copies such as
`triangle_v2.scad`.

## Canonical printable parts

| Source | Quantity | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `parts/triangle.scad` | 20 | Triangle filler with three PCB-safe mounts |
| `parts/pentagon_u.scad` | 12 | Pentagon U-frame holding an additional LED panel |
| `parts/middle_panel_connector.scad` | 12 | Rounded connector between the centre and outer panels |

Each source defaults to `mode = "print"`. Change the mode locally to inspect
its assembly/preview geometry, but do not commit a mode change unless it is an
intentional project change.

## Known physical constraints

- PCB: 66 x 65 x 0.8 mm
- Corner-hole centres: 8 mm from the PCB edges
- Middle hole on a 66 mm edge: 25 mm from an outer hole
- Fasteners: M2
- Printed pilot: 1.6 mm
- Screw lead-in: 3.2 mm diameter x 0.7 mm deep
- Square/pentagon inside dihedral: 148.282526 degrees
- Small fold angle: 31.717474 degrees

See [refs/pcb_dimensions.md](refs/pcb_dimensions.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
before changing geometry.

## Build locally

Install OpenSCAD, then run:

```bash
mkdir -p build
openscad -o build/triangle.stl parts/triangle.scad
openscad -o build/pentagon_u.stl parts/pentagon_u.scad
openscad -o build/middle_panel_connector.stl parts/middle_panel_connector.scad
```

Generated STL and PNG files belong in `build/` and are intentionally ignored.
GitHub Actions renders all three models on every push and pull request and
publishes the generated files as workflow artifacts.

## Physical iteration workflow

1. Make one focused change to a canonical source file.
2. Render the part and inspect assembly mode where relevant.
3. Open a pull request and download the generated STL artifact.
4. Record print settings and fit results with the physical-fit issue template.
5. Link the physical test to the commit or pull request.
6. Tag known-good printed milestones instead of copying source files.
