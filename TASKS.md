# Project task board

Last reconciled: 2026-08-27
Integration baseline: `main`, including the unified UI, Manifold-only
fabrication, checked WLED simulator runtime, and Schema 2-only mapping path.

Current milestone: copy the complete loaded simulator to one ESP32, then prove
static address and RGB parity on the physical 41-panel sculpture.

## Control rules

1. Use stable task IDs in commits and handoffs.
2. Lifecycle: **Backlog -> Ready -> In Progress -> Blocked or Human Review ->
   Ready to Merge -> Done**.
3. Keep at most one implementation slice In Progress. Bounded audits may run in
   parallel when their files do not overlap.
4. Record scope, acceptance, dependencies, verification, owner branch/worktree,
   and likely conflicts only when useful.
5. Use FAST by default, STANDARD for substantial normal features, and QUALITY
   for architecture, geometry, conflict, ambiguity, or high risk. Escalate
   Luna -> Terra -> Sol only when evidence requires it.
6. FAST needs orchestrator diff inspection and focused checks. Use an
   independent review when justified in STANDARD and for QUALITY/high-risk work.
7. Completed task-branch work stops at Ready to Merge. Integrate into `main`
   only with explicit operator authorization. After verified integration and
   push, move the task to Done and clean up only task-owned resources.
8. Never force-push, discard unfamiliar changes, or delete another owner's
   branch or worktree.
9. Stop when acceptance criteria and relevant checks pass. Record later ideas
   as separate tasks.

## Backlog

## Ready

No tasks.

## In Progress

No tasks.

## Blocked

### `MECH-020` Add correction tools for a proven ambiguous gap case

- Blocked by: a concrete project whose boundary gap cannot be represented or
  corrected by the current editor.
- Needed: the smallest failing Schema 2 project and the intended corrected
  corner cycle.

### `FAB-020` Add one evidence-backed fabrication enhancement

- Blocked by: a real printed-model need that is not covered by current ribbons,
  LED-surface bridges, or planar closures.
- Needed: the affected project, failed physical result, and required fit or
  fabrication outcome.

### `FAB-023` Route automatic structural connectors around DIN/DOUT

- Blocked by: the 30-panel bridge path contains exact-zero Manifold triangles;
  naive post-CAD pair exclusion disconnects the degree-2 graph or causes an
  unbounded search.
- Needed: a bounded pre-CAD path optimizer that treats keep-out and printable-
  mesh feasibility as edge costs while preserving the strict final mesh gate.

### `HW-012` Record the installed 41-panel route

- Blocked by: physical assembly.

### `FIRM-010` Add later transport or audio behavior

- Blocked by: `PROOF-010` plus explicit board, network, microphone, and
  transport decisions.

### `PROOF-010` Prove simulator-to-device address and RGB parity

- Blocked by: `HW-012` and an approved powered test setup. DIAG-010 supplies
  the exact offline frame plan.
- Needed: observe and record all 2,624 addresses, row transitions, corners,
  four outputs, and RGB channels against the exact deployment identity.

## Human Review

No tasks.

## Ready to Merge

### `UI-020` Add an interactive data-chain assembly tutorial

- Result: the view-only tutorial derives every available output chain from the
  shared Schema 2 wiring preview. It shows a near-top controller, places cable
  endpoints and inward curves behind the PCBs, uses the existing Output rows as
  the chain selector, and separates chain navigation from wire navigation. The
  current solder connection is bright while every other selected-chain cable
  stays visible in muted gray. It retains referenced printable assets and
  leaves the user-controlled camera unchanged. Draft and review-required routes
  remain marked.
- Verification: 7 tutorial unit tests, 4 focused wiring tests, 3 focused
  Chromium journeys, `npx tsc -b`, `npm run build:web`, diff check, and
  independent review passed.
- Owner: `codex/ui-020-chain-tutorial` in `/tmp/led-rhombo-ui-020`.

## Done

- `FIRM-015`: pose-only panel edits now update and activate the exact spatial
  WLED ledmap before preset persistence and DDP resume. Route, calibration,
  output, color-order, malformed-map, and identity changes remain fail-closed.
  The operator accepted the physical result and requested integration on
  2026-08-27; 387 tests, TypeScript, Vite, and independent review passed.
- `FIRM-014`: copied loaded 1–41-panel simulator playback to WLED with exact
  config, ledmap, preset, and boot-state read-back; gamma-corrected DDP live
  mirroring; bounded reconnect; and persistent native fallback. On 2026-08-26,
  the operator confirmed connection, effect changes, tab-close fallback, page
  reload reconnect, and power-cycle restoration on the 192-LED three-panel
  sculpture.
- `PWR-010`: removed from repository scope by operator decision. External
  electrical design and protection are operator responsibilities; generated
  WLED current values are operating assumptions, not an electrical approval.
- `FIRM-013`: stabilized physical CP2102 flashing, serial Improv setup,
  private-device read-back and reconnect, and the physically mapped live 8x8
  simulator link. The operator completed setup at `192.168.68.53`; 366/366
  tests, TypeScript, Vite, focused browser journeys, and review passed.
- `FIRM-012`: integrated the receipt-verified Advanced Tools ESP32 flash,
  private Wi-Fi provisioning, `loo-ume.local` identity, one-panel simulator
  state transfer, and device read-back; physical browser/USB review passed on
  2026-08-25. Full-install mode remains unavailable.
- `FIRM-011`: the pinned WLED binary flashed successfully to the ESP-WROOM-32;
  the operator confirmed the 64-pixel GPIO16 smoke configuration, GRB colors,
  straight 0–63 row-major address walk, reboot persistence, and stable operation.
- `CAL-011`: measured GRB/order-0 and front-view straight row-major addressing
  are integrated in `main` at `80a1225`; mapping fingerprint is `73b36d49`.
- `DIAG-010`, `ARCH-010`, `CAD-020`, `PLACE-010`, `FAB-022`, `SEC-010`, and
  `MAP-020`: the reviewed unblocked implementation batch is integrated in
  `main` at `d51e8bb`; integrated Vitest passed 348/348 with TypeScript and Vite.
- `HR-006`: operator printed representative Manifold parts and confirmed on
  2026-08-25 that they work.
- `FAB-021`: corrected structural PCB back-view coordinates and added
  fail-closed DIN/DOUT keep-outs for ribbons, LED-surface bridges, and merged
  junctions in `main` at `4961f4d`; unsafe automatic paths now stop instead of
  exporting overlapping parts.
- `DOC-010`: integrated the ten-page connector design-process HTML/PDF and five
  current UI images in `main` at `4c8c82c`; its task worktree and branches were
  removed after the verified push.
- `TRUSS-011`: integrated connector ribbons, LED-surface bridges, four JSON
  presets, switchable surface/free-6DOF editing, Advanced Tools settings, and
  exact displayed-connector ZIP export in `main` at `641cf6b`; its source and
  integration worktrees and branches were removed after documentation and
  integration completed.
- `INSTALL-012`: the restricted-PATH one-command setup passed on Linux x86-64
  and native macOS arm64/x86-64 in integration run `32656402016`; no global
  Node/npm installation or administrator command is required.
- `INSTALL-011`: added one-command pinned repository-local Node/npm setup,
  locked dependency installation, desktop build, and Manifold production proof.
- `VALID-011`: centralized deep Schema 2 validation for browser and CLI input,
  including mapping, calibration, boundary, asset, and note contracts.
- `VALID-010`: made LED grid dimensions profile-driven through mapping,
  validation, export, reload, rendering, and rectangular-turn safeguards.
- `LEGACY-011`: retired the Schema 1 schema, migration fixture/script,
  procedural mapping path, and legacy-only tests; the 41-panel Schema 2 project
  and deployment artifacts remain byte-identical.
- `BUILD-010`: normal development and CI now verify the checked-in WLED
  simulator without Python, Emscripten, or a WLED checkout. Reproducible source
  generation remains on `generate/wled-simulator` at `64b743a`.
- `WIRE-012`: integrated the shared guarded browser/CLI deployment policy in
  `main` at `d900cdb`; mapping-ready input gets exact WLED installation files,
  while draft or stale input gets only explicit diagnostic artifacts.
- `CTRL-008`: recorded the operator-approved visual, panel-profile, WLED
  generation, Schema 2, stale-mechanics, and boundary-format decisions in
  `main` at `ee8f79f`; physical Manifold print review remains open as `HR-006`.
- `UI-011`: operator approved the opaque glossy black PCB appearance.
- `CAL-010`: operator approved the existing panel profile for the current
  41-panel build. Existing measured values stay measured; provisional or
  unknown electrical, pad, and address facts are not relabelled as measurements
  and remain subject to `PROOF-010`.
- `HR-013`: normal `main` will use the checked-in WLED simulator and will not
  require Python or Emscripten; reproducible generation moves to a dedicated
  branch under `BUILD-010`.
- `HR-005`: confirmed the 41-panel authority is Schema 2; `LEGACY-011` retired
  the remaining Schema 1 migration dependencies.
- `HR-008`: stale generated parts stay hidden until regeneration; no stale-part
  inspection toggle is required.
- `HR-009`: keep JSON poses/topology and STL output; do not add another boundary
  asset format without a concrete future need.
- `UI-019`: removed the performance overlay and individual-file export menu,
  moved secondary display and GLB controls into Advanced Tools, and unified
  operator messages in one activity log in `main` at `6615c54`.
- `CTRL-007`: removed the retired printable toolchain and its generated
  artifacts, made Manifold the only printable-parts kernel, and established
  FAST/STANDARD/QUALITY execution and Luna/Terra/Sol routing in `main` at
  `33d6455`.
- `UI-012`–`UI-018`: integrated browser-first Manifold status, generation,
  package/manual downloads, bounded JSON fallback, simplified controls, and
  unified project/route/package workflow in `main` at `e278333`.
- `CAD-030`–`CAD-037`: pinned Manifold solids, browser/local compilation,
  exact assets, pose-only caps, labels, planar tolerances, and CI proof.
- `WIRE-010`–`WIRE-015`, `MAP-021`, `MAP-022`, `MAP-030`, `HW-016`, `HW-017`:
  authored routes, lifecycle, route editor, assembly manual, installed address
  transforms, GPIO/bus contract, and corrected mapping assumptions.
- `CORE-001`, `ASSET-001`, `BOUNDARY-001`, `PARTS-001`, `PORTABLE-001`,
  `TEST-010`, `TEST-011`: pose-first editor, portable assets, validated
  boundary, exact parts, folder/ZIP support, and real browser journeys.
- `CTRL-001`–`CTRL-005`: persistent task board, safe workflow, failure learning,
  architecture reconstruction, and simulator-to-hardware priority.
